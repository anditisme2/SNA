# SNA (Instagram Influencer Network Analysis)

Build the foundations for a **social network analysis and influencer analytics tool** by leveraging Python, pandas, NetworkX, matplotlib, and more.

The goal of this project is to explore the structure of influencer networks on Instagram and understand how network position relates to engagement performance. This project serves as both a **data analysis case study** and a **reusable foundation** for building similar social media analytics tools.


## Project Goals

- Construct an influencer network graph from follower/following, mentions, or collaboration data.
- Apply Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques to identify central influencers and communities.
- Measure and correlate network position with engagement metrics such as likes, comments, and follower growth.
- Produce clear visualizations to illustrate findings.

When complete, this project will give you:
- A reproducible workflow for collecting and analyzing network data.
- Insights into influencer marketing patterns.
- Portfolio-ready visualizations and statistical findings.
